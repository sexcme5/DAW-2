# DAW-2
This code creates a professional-looking WebDAW with the following features:

    Modern, dark theme interface
    Track management (add/remove tracks)
    Transport controls (play, stop, record)
    Tempo and time signature controls
    Metronome functionality
    Timeline editor with clip manipulation
    Responsive layout
    Professional styling and spacing

To use this DAW:

    Copy the code into an HTML file
    Open it in a modern web browser
    Use the transport controls to manage playback
    Add tracks using the "Add Track" button
    Modify tempo and time signature using the controls
    Interact with the timeline to position clips

Note: This is a basic implementation. To make it fully functional, you'd need to:

    Implement the Web Audio API for actual audio processing
    Add MIDI support for recording and playback
    Implement clip editing functionality
    Add effects processing
    Include file import/export functionality
    Add user preferences and settings
    Implement undo/redo functionality
